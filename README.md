# RustML

RustML is a machine learning framework developed entirely from scratch with an emphasis on performance and memory safety. All of the source code in this repository is developed without any external crates for machine learning, meaning that apart from Cuda linear algebra, the nodes, layers, and neural networks are all implemented from scratch.

### Breakdown
RustML is a continous project. Our goal is to keep developing the framework from the ground up, eventually reaching the latest developments in machine learning research. As of the latest commits, RustML contains support for individual nodes, layers, and neural networks for a standard Neural Network based project. Expansion is headed in the direction of Convolutional Neural Networks currently, but we hope to reach GANS, Large Language Models, Transformers, and BERTS eventually. 


### Author Note
Although Aayush Sharma has no direct commits on this repository, the majority of this source code was constructed with his help. On the repository linked below, he created the majority of the Python framework, while I have been more focused on working with the Rust language.
